    When we first started, we both thought — damn, everything’s going so smoothly, and it’ll always stay this way. But life? Life has a funny way of reminding us that it’s never just one note.  
    <br><br>
    I know you probably thought I forgot about our 6-month anniversary. Maybe you even cried. And if you did, I can imagine exactly how that felt. But baby, no — I haven’t forgotten a single thing.  
    <br><br>
    These past six months with you? They’ve been nothing short of extraordinary. From the little fights to the long-overdue talks, from moments of silence to bursts of laughter — this relationship has seen it all. And I’m just grateful I got to go through all of it <em>with you</em>.  
    <br><br>
    Because if it hadn’t been you, I honestly don’t think I could’ve loved anyone else. No one else would’ve <em>been</em> you.  
    <br><br>
    Shreya, you are — without question — the most beautiful woman on this earth to me. And I guarantee you that feeling will never change.  
    <br><br>
    I want to see you grow. I want to watch you evolve. Get fat, get old, cry over a sad movie, or scream at me because I forgot to take the food off the stove. I don’t care. I’ll still love you the same. You’ll always be my pretty baby.  
    <br><br>
    I’ve written so many things for you over these past six months. And yet, it all feels like so little compared to what you’ve given me.  
    <br><br>
    You gave me a new life.  
    <br><br>
    I was in a dark place — depressed, overwhelmed, done with everything. And then you came into my life and snapped me out of it. Not literally, of course. But in a way only you could, it was like you shouted, <strong>“Uth ja, bkl,”</strong> straight into my soul — with that fire, that Shreya energy no one else has.  
    <br><br>
    And that’s when I fell for you. Truly. Fully. Irrevocably.  
    <br><br>
    From that moment until now, and for every moment that’ll come after, I’ve loved you — and I will keep loving you.  
    <br><br>
    Thank you, Shreya. For everything. For every single thing you’ve ever done for me, even the things you didn’t realize meant so much.  
    <br><br>
    Someday, in a few years, I’ll ask you something really important. And I hope you’ll say yes.  
    <br><br>
    You’re my beautiful baby. You always have been. You always will be.  
    <br><br>
    Muuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😘
